People often describe themselves as being addicted to, for example, a TV show or shopping.

Actually, the next two weeks show nothing but storms. You’re stuck in this crappy weather pattern and there seems to be no relief in sight. You might feel alone, but you have lots of company. Depression—or major depressive disorder (MDD), the term for clinical depression—is one of the most common mental health conditions, affecting an estimated 350 million people in all age groups.",

                Why Should You Read A Blog?

              Mental illness is real and it isn't always in a person's control.
              People who live with mental health conditions are not alone-there
              is hope. Patients, caregivers and even psychologists are using
              blogs and other social media to boost understanding, share
              resources, fight stigma and help each other - and themselves.
