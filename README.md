## Problem Statement  
Due to COVID-19 outbreak everything became digitalized, so people forgot how to socialise with their fellow beings and friends, so this leads to depression, anxiety and other mental health issues. So our website helps them to socialise digitally and open up their feelings in front of random strangers and professional psychologists anonymously.

## Idea  
Our website provides a platform to the people who are facing mental issues so that they can express their feelings in front of strangers without the fear of being judged and they can also consult a professional psychologist. Generally, when people are bored they start overthinking and they get depressed, so our platform provides blogs, news, memes in the attempt of curing their boredom.

## Features
Our Platform has following features <br>
     1. Consulting with professional psychologists
     2. Voice Chat with random strangers  
     3. Providing daily blogs related to mental health  
     4. Adding laughter to your life through memes

## Tech Stack Used
