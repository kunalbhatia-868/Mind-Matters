## Problem Statement  
Due to COVID-19 outbreak everything became digitalized, so people forgot how to socialise with their fellow beings and friends, so this leads to depression, anxiety and other mental health issues. So our website helps them to socialise digitally and open up their feelings in front of random strangers and professional psychologists anonymously.

## Idea  
Our website provides a platform to the people who are facing mental issues so that they can express their feelings in front of strangers without the fear of being judged and they can also consult a professional psychologist. Generally, when people are bored they start overthinking and they get depressed, so our platform provides blogs, news, memes in the attempt of curing their boredom.

## Features
Our Platform has following features 
     1. Consulting with professional psychologists
     2. Voice Chat with random strangers  
     3. Sh  
     4. Coding events  
     5. Student Community Programmes

## Impact on society  
 1. Our project will impact the coding students who have the capability but arenâ€™t able to get the best just because of missing some awesome opportunities. 
 2. Students who have just starting coding and are looking for hackathons to build  expertise,  and are already experienced coders who are looking for good internships or job opportunities .
